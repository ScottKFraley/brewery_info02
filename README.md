# brewery_info02

This is my demo Flutter project. It finds Breweries in the vicinity of your phone / device.

It was written my me, Scott Fraley after only about a month or so of learning / ramp-up in the framework and language.

## Getting Started

In order to build and run this app, you will of course need to install the [Flutter framework](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) / application.

> "Installing the Flutter framework will also install the Dart SDK, as well as everything else that is needed to build a Flutter application. Flutter is a complete software development kit (SDK) that includes everything you need to build cross-platform applications for mobile, web, and desktop. This includes the Dart programming language, the Flutter framework, and a set of tools for developing, testing, and deploying your applications." -Google's Gen AI


### A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
